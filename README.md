Compile: Run the makefile

How to use:

There is a configuration file, which is used as an input for the offload_simulator.

Run the offload simulator from one terminal using "./offload_simulator config.txt", and then from another terminal send commands using for example "./mobile_nodes 2 1000 1000 20000" .

Use Ctrl+C to finish the offload simulator and Ctrl+Z to print statistics
